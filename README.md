# FunctionGraph
Show the graph of specified function on Android platform.

A module which is able to show the funtion graph as you input the mathmatic funtion.The graph can be draged with 
Inertia effect.Now this project is still in developing period,utill now it just support "+,-,*,/,sin,cos,tan",and the kernel problem is it
will be not smooth when the funtion is a little complecated.I will deal with this problem sometime in the future.
